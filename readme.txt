• Solution focuses on frontend UI Automation

• Reasoning behind your technical choices, including architectural. - I have Used both Data driven & Page Object Model. As it is easy to 
access the element & maintainability & readability of the code is easy. 
• Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if
you were to spend additional time on the project. 
- I could have automated the sequencing, Sign-Up & other funcationlity available on the page, if I spend additioanl time.
